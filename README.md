My very first experience with Rails — completed in one day, following this tutorial:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#introduction

Along the way, I encountered and fixed some bugs with the help of the almighty Internet!


What I've learned from this lab:

* Rails directory structure and guiding principles
  
* Basics of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture

* Creating and modifying databases

* Interacting with database tables via the Rails console

* Routing and URL mapping

* Controllers and actions

* Adding authentication to control database access

* Integrating rich text and file uploads

* Supporting multiple languages by creating locales/*.yml files

* Sending emails via Mailers for subscription functionality

* Editing JavaScript and CSS to customize the front-end appearance

* Running tests and fixing formatting inconsistencies automatically

* Pushing the project to GitHub, including filtered content such as the database and Active Storage files
  
Here are couple of screenshots from the lab:
